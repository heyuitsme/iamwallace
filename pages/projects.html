                        Search is a key pillar in any functioning online marketplace. Rarely do users land on a marketplace accidentally, hoping to discover something new. This is especially true for live event ticketing marketplaces such as Vivid Seats (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/seat" target="_blank">NASDAQ: SEAT</a>), where 2M+ users a day are actively searching for tickets to specific events. In this scenario, we need performant and relevant search to ensure the greatest user experience.

                        During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Canada announced the creation of Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) that provided eligible users affected by the pandemic, a recurring stipend. During periods when users were unable to work either due to illness, shortage of work or quarantine, the benefit would be paid out via cheques or direct deposit.

                            <li>Signing up for online access to CRA and enrolling in direct deposit would take 10+ days.</li>
                            <li>Financial institutions did not provide a way to enroll for direct deposit.</li>

                        Driving the growth and adoption of a platform is not a simple task. This difficulty is further compounded when the product is ancillary to a userâ€™s established workflow, is subject to periodicity, and when the customer and the user are different. With BenchSci, I was tasked with driving the growth and adoption of the platform by establishing Product Led Growth (PLG) in the platform and as an organization-wide mindset.

                        When a user enters the shopping journey and completes search, finds what they are looking for, and arrives at the final step of checkout, the last thing most marketplaces want is to lose this high-intent user just as they are completing payment and submitting their order. With Vivid Seats operating in the highly competitive secondary live event ticketing space, along with search, payments is a key pillar to ensuring a positive user experience (reliability, speed, and options) and ensuring that business goals are met (GOV).
